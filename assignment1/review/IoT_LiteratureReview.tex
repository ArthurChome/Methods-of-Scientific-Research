%\section{Introduction}
The Internet of Things is an emerging technology\cite{atzori2010internet} stemming from the increase in our environment of smart devices able to connect to other devices and generate and broadcast data to each other. It has grown to also encompass surrounding "things" of a human’s living space such as home appliances, machines, transportation, business storage, etc. Fortino's book\cite{fortino2014internet} offers a clear overview on the matter in terms of technology, middleware and applications. It could offer opportunities to improve businesses' supply chain\cite{ben2019internet} by analysing the raw data streams to extract useful information. With the Internet of Things becoming more and more present in every day life, security has become more important than ever.

%\section{Aspects of Security}

IoT's main characteristics\cite{oh2017security} are its heterogeneity, resource constraints and dynamic nature. Having a diverse range of connected devices means they individually have different used protocols\cite{sethi2017internet}, abstractions, performances and specifications with an absence of common security services.

%\subsection{Secure Communication}
The dynamic nature of the Internet of Things adds challenges when generating keys\cite{roman2011key} and distributing them to nodes in the network. To encode data, one can go for a symmetric\cite{gomes2014internet} or asymmetric key encryption scheme. The choice depends on the situation at hand and the trade-offs to be made involving management of the limited device resources\cite{katagi2008lightweight} and the scalability of the IoT network\cite{gomes2014internet}.

%\subsection{Authentication}
Before a secure communication can be established however, the sender must have a way to verify the identity of a network node before sending anything. Using certificate-based handshakes\cite{hummen2014site} is a possibility but it has been proven to be infeasible for a wide range of constrained device that comprise the Internet of Things. Researcher Rene Hummen from Aachen University proposes coding a node's identity in certificates \cite{hummen2013towards} and use it to authorize communication. A centralised approach involves using Registration Authorities\cite{liu2012authentication} to recognize network players, they are access points in which other nodes can pre-register as to be identified on the network later on. Another paper\cite{jan2014robust} appears to have developed a light-weight authentication protocol to manage devices' resources based on Liu's paper. 

%\subsection{Data Provenance}
When multiple devices interchange data in a network, one must be able to verify the integrity and correctness of data processed by the application. Researcher Muhammad Aman focuses on leveraging Physically Unclonable Functions \cite{aman2017secure} to uniquely identify devices within a network. Another of Aman's papers\cite{javaid2018blockpro} proposes the combination of blockchain with physically unclonable functions as to guarantee secure data provenance.
Another way would be using a hash chain scheme\cite{suhail2018data} to encode provenance where the hash of data would be prolonged for every new node that the data passes allowing for a checksum to be made in the end. Furthermore, data provenance can be secured using a mutual agreement scheme\cite{rangwala2016mutual} between sender and receiver.

%\subsection{Access Control}
Implementing access control can be with a centralised approach\cite{hernandez2013distributed} where one node filters access requests based on the policies at hand. A centralised access controls scheme like this brings considerable drawbacks\cite{ouaddah2017towards} such a lowered scalability and a compromise in end-to-end security properties. Aafaf Ouaddah --from the Institute Mines-Telecom in Paris-- adapted blockchain \cite{ouaddah2016fairaccess} into a decentralized access control manager overcoming the problem of consensus reaching with distributed anonymous participants. Ouaddah also proposed a capability-based access control scheme\cite{ouaddah2017access} by giving tokens or keys to nodes that would grant them access to some restricted resources.

The Internet of Things represents a promising technology with a lot of its key requirements yet to be successfully implemented\cite{borgia2014internet}. Ensuring security is a prerequisite to allow its proper functioning.
